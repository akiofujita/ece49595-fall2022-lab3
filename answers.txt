    The product owner is in charge of setting the direction for the team as well as handling release and stakeholder management.
    This position is very important as it determines the future direction of the product/team and can be a significant factor to a project's success.

(b) The scrum master is responisble for managing all scrum-related tasks. These include JIRA tooling and facilitating sprints and meetings with
    the development team.

(c) The three types of meetings are the Sprint Planning Meeting, Daily Scrum or Standup Meeting, and the Sprint retrospective meeting.
    For the spring planning, the team determines what tasks need to be completed in the upcoming sprint. They also determine story points and assign stories to the team.
    For the daily scrum meeting, this is a short meeting that occurs every day during the sprint. The team discusses the tasks that were finished during the sprint and any changes that need to be made.
    For the sprint retrospective meeting, this occurs at the end of the sprint. The team moves unfinished work to the backlog as well as discuss the completed work.
